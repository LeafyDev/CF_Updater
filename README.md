# CF_Updater
CloudFlare IP Updater in C#

This tool provides an easy way to update the destination of a subdomain of your CloudFlare account.
It includes DNS checking, custom IP, random IP and own IP.

Copy/Paste is available by right clicking the window. Settings can be saved to avoid adding the token and domain every time.

# TODO
Saved custom IPs.
Launch parameters for quick usage.

# NOTE
I know the code isn't perfect, there are probably shorter, better ways of doing it, any suggestions are more than welcome.
